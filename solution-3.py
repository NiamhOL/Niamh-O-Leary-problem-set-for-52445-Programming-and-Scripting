#Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,00 that are divisible by 6 but not 12.

for num in range (1000, 10000): #This identifies the number integers starting from 1000 and ending at 10000. This is a loop statement
    if num % 6 == 0 and num % 12 != 0 #if the number if divisible by 6 but not 12
    print (num) #print
