I am total novice to python and programming in general. Therefore, before I attempted the Problem Set, I did a number of online practical tutorials. I repeated the exercises in these tutorials until I was moer confident with some of the coding and syntaxes used in python.

### **Exercise 1**

Write a programme that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the sum os all numbers between one and that number?

Solution:

### **Exercise 2**

Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T. 
To solve this problem I had to get the current date. 


### **Exercise 3**

Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are devisible by 6 but not 12. 

To solve this problem, I used "for" and "range ()", which allowed me return a sequence of numbers and allowed my program to iterate over a sequence. Which is also called a traversal. By putting range (1000, 10000), I was able to identify the range of numbers I wanted in my sequence from 1000 to 10000. I assigned the identify of "num" to this. I then used an "if" statement to identify all the numbers which were divisible by 6 by using the equals code " a==b". I also a second part to my "if" to allow me identify all the numbers divided by 12, I used the not equals condition "a !=b".

### **Exercise 4**

Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the sucessive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the programe end if the current value is one.
