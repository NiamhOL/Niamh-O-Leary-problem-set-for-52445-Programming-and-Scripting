# **Programming and Scripting Module 2019 - Problem Set Solutions**

## **Name: Niamh O'Leary**

## **Student ID: G00376339**

I am total novice to python and programming in general. Therefore, before I attempted the Problem Set, I did a number of online practical tutorials. I repeated the exercises in these tutorials until I was moer confident with some of the coding and syntaxes used in python.

### **Exercise 1**

Write a programme that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the sum os all numbers between one and that number?

### **Exercise 2**

Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T. 
To solve this problem I had to get the current date.

### **Exercise 3**

Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are devisible by 6 but not 12. 

To solve this problem, I used "for" and "range ()", which allowed me return a sequence of numbers and allowed my program to iterate over a sequence. Which is also called a traversal. By putting range (1000, 10000), I was able to identify the range of numbers I wanted in my sequence from 1000 to 10000. I assigned the identify of "num" to this. I then used an "if" statement to identify all the numbers which were divisible by 6 by using the equals code " a==b". I also a second part to my "if" to allow me identify all the numbers divided by 12, I used the not equals condition "a !=b".

### **Exercise 4**

Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the sucessive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the programe end if the current value is one.

### **Exercise 5**

Write a program that askes the user to input a positive integer and tells the user whether or not the number is a prime.

Before I could start this exercise, I had to research prime numbers. A prime number is a number whose only factors are 1 anf itself. Examples of prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17. Greek mathematician Euclid was the first to provide proof that there are unfinately many primes. Therefore N = p1...pn + 1. The largest know prime number has more that 23 million digits and is referred to as M7723917.

To run a program for this exercise, I had to understand the following topics in Python, if...else statement, Loop, break and contontinue. An "if...else" statement is used to make a decision. A "loop" statement iterates over a sequence. Finally, by using "break and continue", I was able alter the flow of the loop. In this program I have checked if the number inputted by the user is checked if it is a prime number or not. If the number can be divided by any number from 2 to -1, the number is not a prime. Otherwise the number is a prime number.
